# Project - *Web Application - Infrastructure as Code* - Network Structures and Cloud Computing

**Web Application - Infrastructure as Code** is a project which deploys applications by launching the AMI using Amazon Linux 2 via **Packer**, setup autorun using **Systemd**, and using **Terraform** configuration file to create all AWS resources needed.

Submitted by: **Zhengrui Lu**

Time spent: **80** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

### Web Application
* [X] Completed [Product Management Application](https://github.com/ZhengruiLu/webapp).

### Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Packer
* [X] Deployed Application by launching the AMI using Amazon Linux 2 via **Packer**. 
* [X] Setup autorun using **Systemd**.
* [X] Used Terraform configuration file to create all AWS resources needed, such as all networking resources, IAM, and S3 bucket. Domain Name System(DNS) Updates - Route53 resource record. Reduced launch time by 40%.
* [X] Set up the applicationâ€™s database as the Encrypted RDS instance when running on the EC2 instances, which are launched in an auto-scaling group. Created an Application load balancer to accept HTTPS traffic on port 443.
* [X] Set logging using CloudWatch. Retrieved custom metrics with StatsD. Resolving issues promptly.

### CI/CD with [Github Action](https://github.com/ZhengruiLu/webapp/tree/main/.github/workflows)
* [X] Pull Request Raised Workflow.
	* [X] Add a GitHub Action workflow to run the application unit tests for each pull request raised.
    * [X] A pull request can only be merged if the workflow executes successfully.
* [X] Pull Request Merged Workflow.
	* [X] Add another GitHub actions workflow and configure it to be triggered when a pull request is merged. This workflow should do the following:
		- a. Run the unit test.
		- b. Validate Packer Template
		- c. Build Application Artifact(s)
		- d. Build AMI
			- i. Upgrade OS packages
			- ii. Install dependencies (python, node.js, etc.)
			- iii. Install application dependencies (pip install for Python)
			- iv. Set up the application by copying the application artifacts and the configuration files.
			- v. Configure the application to start automatically when VM is launched.
		- e. Create a new Launch Template version with the latest AMI ID for the autoscaling group. The autoscaling group should be configured to use the latest version of the Launch Template.
		- f. Issue command to the auto-scale group to do an instance refresh.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

### Web Application Dev
* [X] CI/CD for Web Application.

### Cloud
* [X] Understand the functions and application methods of AWS-related services.
* [X] Test auto-scaling group and load balancer
